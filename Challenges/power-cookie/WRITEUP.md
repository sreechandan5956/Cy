# Power Cookie Challenge — Technical Analysis

## Summary
The application demonstrates a fundamental security flaw: authorization is based entirely on a client-controlled cookie. The server assigns a cookie `isAdmin=0` and later checks this value to determine whether to display privileged content.

Because the cookie originates from and is modifiable by the client, privilege escalation is trivial.

## Application Behavior
1. `index.php` sets a cookie if one does not already exist:
   ```php
   if (!isset($_COOKIE['isAdmin'])) {
       setcookie("isAdmin", "0", time() + 3600, "/");
   }
   ```
* Cookie is neither signed nor validated.

* No integrity or authenticity protection.

2. `check.php` performs authorization using:
```
$isAdmin = intval($_COOKIE['isAdmin']);<br>
if ($isAdmin === 1) { /* show admin content */ }<br>
```
* Direct reliance on untrusted client input.

* No server-side session or role verification.

Modify the isAdmin cookie in the browser or via a crafted HTTP request:

Reloading the page results in the application treating the client as an administrator.

### Root Cause
The system conflates authentication/authorization state with client-controlled cookie values. Cookies are not inherently secure and can be manipulated freely by the user.

### Conclusion
The challenge clearly illustrates why client-side data cannot be trusted for security decisions. All authorization logic must be enforced server-side with authenticated, integrity-protected state.
